# Enhancing-PCOS-Detection
This project presents a hybrid diagnostic system for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) that leverages both machine learning on clinical blood parameters and deep learning on ultrasound images. The primary objective is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity by integrating two commonly used modalities—blood reports and USG imaging—into a unified framework. Given that PCOS is a prevalent hormonal disorder often undiagnosed due to limitations in existing diagnostic techniques, this work aims to fill the gap by developing a more robust and reliable detection system.

The project is divided into three main components: Blood Profile Analysis, Ultrasound Imaging Analysis, and Hybrid Integration. In the blood profile analysis module, a dataset from Kaggle—collected from ten hospitals in Kerala—is used, containing 44 physical and clinical attributes. Extensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) were performed to extract meaningful insights and eliminate inconsistencies. Various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, LDA, XGBoost, and ExtraTreesClassifier were applied. The ExtraTreesClassifier achieved the highest accuracy of 99.81%, making it the best-performing model for this part.

The ultrasound imaging analysis focuses on classifying ovary images into PCOS-infected and healthy categories. The dataset contains labeled ultrasound images of infected and non-infected ovaries. Two deep learning architectures were used—CNN and ResNet50 (via transfer learning). Images were augmented for better generalization, and the CNN model reached an impressive accuracy of 99.73%, while ResNet50 achieved 95.05%. The models were evaluated using accuracy vs. epochs, loss vs. epochs, ROC curves, and precision-recall metrics.

For integration, the final decision-making model combines the predictions from the blood report model (ExtraTreesClassifier) and the ultrasound model (CNN). If both models indicate PCOS, the diagnosis is highly likely. If only one model indicates PCOS, the system recommends further hormonal testing. If both models predict non-PCOS, the individual is considered at low risk. This logical combination reflects real-world diagnostic practices and was validated in consultation with medical professionals.

To run this project, clone the repository, install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt, and launch the provided Jupyter Notebook. You’ll also need to manually download the datasets from Kaggle and place them in the appropriate directories as outlined in the notebook. The complete pipeline—from data preprocessing to model evaluation and decision integration—is fully documented and executable.

This project not only showcases the power of combining ML and DL for healthcare applications but also emphasizes the importance of precision medicine. Future directions include incorporating more hormonal parameters (e.g., testosterone, cortisol, HbA1c), expanding the image dataset, and eventually deploying the solution as a web-based diagnostic tool.
